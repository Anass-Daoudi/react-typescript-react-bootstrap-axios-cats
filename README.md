# Hey, welcome in my React.js demo application

My goal from this demo is to integrate multiple libraries to work on different needs that occur commonly for most of production level applications.

**For example:**

- I used <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/#installation'>create react app with TypeScript template</a> so as to start as fast as possible implementing and delivering features. Other approach could be configuring Webpack from scratch. I prefer to start with the first approach and in need eject the Webpack configuration and customize it depending on the need.
- TypeScript help teams work together by for example having shared models using interfaces or classes...etc, have IDE or editor auto completion, prevent bugs related to typings...
- I used <a target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' href='https://react-bootstrap.github.io/'>React Bootstrap</a> (with Bootstrap of course as a dependency) to easily build UI using React component style instead of css classes.
- I used Axios for API calls.
- I didn't have a direct need to use a state management tool for this demo, but I'm thinking to add **Redux** and **React Redux** for a demo purpose.
- Finally I used **.env.production** and **.env.development** to demonstrate how we could customize configuration per environment. For example change API base url depending on the running environment.
